* Synthesizer

    MA-3 (MobileAudio3 item turn YMU762-Q) FM sound source system
    (2 operator /4 operators) with it is the hybrid sound source LSI
    of WaveTable sound source system. The FM sound source operational
    mode is two, the maximum number of voices differs depending upon
    this operational mode. Operational mode of 1 stuffing is mode of
    all 2 operator operations and the number of voices becomes 32 sounds.
    Operational mode of 2 stuffing is the mode of 4 operator operational
    possibilities and the number of voices becomes 16 sounds. On the one
    hand total of the number of voices of the WaveTable sound source has
    become 8 sounds. These sound sources keep the playback rate of 48Khz.

    The control logic of MA-3 has dynamic voice management mechanism.
    Because of this the number of voices is shared without voice being
    possessed, in all channel in each MIDI channel.

    ?????ƒ?????????and the static PCM data etc. of the FM sound source
    and the WaveTable sound source are recorded to the joint ownership RAM
    area of MA-3. This RAM area is 8176 bytes, to utilize it
    cannot do the musical instrument information which exceeds this size. 

* FM

    As for the parameter of FM it is possible to combine the algorithm
    of self feedback appointment and 8 types of 8 stages. Being 4 operator
    possible modes, 2 operators it is possible to operate, with selecting
    algorithm, but that opposite is impossible.

    Common parameter below exists in one musical instrument.

        Algorithm: 0 - 7
        LFO: 0 - 3
        Pan (Panpot): 0 - 31
        Pan switch (PE)

    Parameter below exists in each operator.

        Feedback (FB): However it depends on algorithm.
        Operator switch
        Multiple (MULTI): 0 - 15
        ??ƒ??? (DT): 0 - 7
        Attack rate (AR): 0 - 15
        Decay rate (DR): 0 - 15
        Sustain rate (SR): 0 - 15
        Release rate (RR): 0 - 15
        Sustain level (SL): 0 - 15
        Total level (TL): 0 - 63
        Key scale level (KSL): 0 - 3
        AM modulation depth (DAM): 0 - 3
        PM modulation depth (DVB): 0 - 3
        Ripple mark (WS): 0 - 31
        Key off switch (XOF)
        Sustain switch (SUS)
        Key scale rate switch (KSR)
        AM modulation switch (EAM)
        PM modulation switch (EVB)

    As for articulation information of 2 operator musical instruments
    16 bytes, as for articulation information of 4 operator musical
    instruments the RAM area of 30 bytes is consumed in each musical
    instrument. Because of this, the number of register possible musical
    instruments when are only 2 operator musical instruments, becomes
    with 511, when are only 4 operator musical instruments, becomes with
    272.

    In the wavetable 2048 bytes (the 16bit1024 sample) the wavetable
    it is the additional register possible to 3 types. This register
    wavetable is shared with all articulations. 

* WaveTable

    The maximum number of voices of WaveTable is shared with static PCM
    and stream PCM. When 1 voice it allots to stream PCM, static PCM
    operates with maximum of 7 voices, when 2 voices it allots to stream
    PCM, static PCM operates with maximum of 6 voices. Articulation
    information of the static PCM musical instrument consumes the RAM
    area of 14 bytes. In addition, the RAM area of 1024 bytes
    is consumed in allotment of stream PCM concerning 1 voice.

    Is possible the fact that 8bitPCM and 4bitADPCM are used to the
    PCM data.

    Parameter below exists in static PCM.

        LFO: 0 - 3
        Pan (Panpot): 0 - 31
        Attack rate (AR): 0 - 15
        Decay rate (DR): 0 - 15
        Sustain rate (SR): 0 - 15
        Release rate (RR): 0 - 15
        Sustain level (SL): 0 - 15
        Total level (TL): 0 - 63
        Key scale level (KSL): 0 - 3
        AM modulation depth (DAM): 0 - 3
        PM modulation depth (DVB): 0 - 3
        Sampling rate (Fs): 1500 - 48000
        Loop point (LoopPoint)
        End point (EndPoint)
        Key off switch (XOF)
        Sustain switch (SUS)
        Key scale rate switch (KSR)
        AM modulation switch (EAM)
        PM modulation switch (EVB)
        Pan switch (PE)
        ROM switch (RM)

* ROM

    The GM128 timbre and the drum 40 timbre, the wavetable of 7 types is
    recorded to the musical instrument of the WaveTable sound source to
    the musical instrument of the FM sound source in the ROM area
    of MA-3.
