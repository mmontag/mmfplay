MMFplay - A player for SMAF files


Current status:

- tested in Linux
- compiles on Linux, Solaris and BSD
- plays MA-3 SMAF files using GM instruments in YMF262 (4OP and 2OP modes)
- doesn't understand SMAF files converted from SMF
- with OPL2 output it sounds bad
- with OPL3 output it sounds really bad
- testing with BlueGrass.mmf, Carousel.mmf and MachineWoman.mmf


TODO:

- check possibility of converting ymu762 tones to ymf262
- build a ymu762 emulator
- support smaf files converted from smf
- support multi-track midi
- implement midi controllers
