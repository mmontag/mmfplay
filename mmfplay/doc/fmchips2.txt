YMF289B (OPL3-L)

The YMF289B (OPL3-L) is a synthesizer chip developed specially
for notebook PCs and PCMCIA (Type II) cards. The YMF289B is
compatible with the YMF262, the de facto standard in the sound
card industry. Special functions such as power down mode and
3.3V power supply are new features that distinguish this
quality chip.

  	
YMF715E (OPL3-SA3)

The YMF715E (OPL3-SA3) is a single audio chip that integrates
the OPL3 chip with DAC, 16 bit sigma-delta CODEC, MPU401 MIDI
interface, joystick port and a 3D enhanced controller. The LSI
also includes all analog components which are suitable for
multimedia applications. It is fully compliant with Plug and Play
ISA 1.0a and supports necessary PC '97 features such as 16 bit
address decoding as well as more IRQs and DMAs. Expandability
options such as zoomed video, modem and CD-ROM interface are
also support by the YMF715E. An additional power management
feature handles power-conscious applications by allowing power
down, power save, partial power down and suspend/resume modes.


YMF721 (OPL4-ML2)

The YMF721 (OPL4-ML2) is a high quality yet low cost Wavetable
synthesizer LSI. The YMF721 integrates an OPL3 (FM synthesizer),
General MIDI processor and 1MB Wavetable sample ROM into one chip.
The LSI complies with General MIDI (GM) system level 1 and is
best suited for multimedia applications, sound cards, MIDI
synthesis modules and other sound applications. The YMF721 can
output stereophonic 16 bit digital signal (fs=44.1 kHz), allowing
it to be connected directly to the YMF701B, 711 or 715 (OPL3-SA,
SA2 or SA3) as well as the YAC516 (DAC16-L). With an operating
voltage of 3.3V, this LSI can also be controlled by notebook PCs.
The power management functions (power down and suspend/resume)
further minimizes the power consumption of notebook PCs and
desktop PCs.

  	
YMF724F (DS-1)

The YMF724F (DS-1) is a high performance audio controller for the
PCI Bus. The DS-1 consists of two separated functional blocks: the
PCI Audio block and the Legacy Audio block. The PCI Audio block
allows a software driver to handle a maximum of 73 concurrent
audio streams by utilizing the Bus Master DMA engine. The PCI
Audio Engine converts the sampling rate of each audio stream: the
streams can thus be mixed without utilizing the CPU and minimizes
system latency. By using Yamaha's software driver, PCI Audio
provides 64-voice XG wavetable synthesizer with reverb, chorus and
variation. It also supports DirectSound hardware accelerator,
Downloadable Sound (DLS), DirectSound3D hardware accelerator, and
DirectMusic hardware accelerator.
