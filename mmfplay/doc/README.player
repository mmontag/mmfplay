What we call "midi player" is like a midi sequencer with many
channels per track, and what we call "sequencer" is like a 
tracker, with only one sound channel per track.


Note playing call flow:

play.c:	playmtsq() 
  player.c: play_midi()
    player.c: play_midi_tick()
      player.c: play_midi_event()
        sequencer.c: seq_set_*()
    sound.c: play_tick()
      sequencer.c: seq_tick()
         

FM synthesizer:

The package currently uses the YMF262 (OPL3) FM chip for tone
generation. Yamaha SMAF files are designed for the YMU762 (MA-3)
and similar chips (MA-2, MA-5). The reasons for using the
YMF262 are:

* There is an emulator available, currently there are no open
  source MA-3 emulators I'm aware of.

* 4 operator FM sound synthesis is similar in MA-3 and OPL3.

* It's easier to find a GM instrument bank for the YMF262 than,
  say, the YM2151 or YM2608.

The disadvantages are:

* No PCM output.

* Only 6 4-op FM channels per chip.

* Custom MA-3 instruments (stored as SysEx events in the SMAF
  file) can't be programmed in the YMF262.

The player architecture allows easy replacement of the YM262
emulator by other sound generators.
