<h2>Successive FM sound source chip</h2>

<i>Excerpt from <a href="http://saw.minidns.net/sound/">http://saw.minidns.net/sound/</a>, translated with babelfish.</i>

<p>

It tried arranging the FM sound source classified by type.
As for MA-2/3 of the portable telephone it is found that it is 
the chip which is decended of OPL.
Nevertheless, that as for those where you think whether why the 
FM sound source is not adopted for the portable game machine am not 
just I, probably will be.
PCM 2 sounds it just added also GBA, to former GB, and.<br>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tbody><tr><th width="60">OPL system</th>
<td>OPL (YM3526) / OPLL (YM2413) / OPL2 (YM3812) / OPL3 (YMF262) 
there was, was used in MSX and the sound blaster. Also the
FM sound source of the Sega master system seems like OPL. 
Basically they are 2 operators, but there are also 4 operator 
modes in OPL3. With the rhythm sound source, the basic ripple 
mark can be selected from several types.</td></tr>
<tr><th>OPM</th>
<td>Tip/chip name with YM2151, was used with the X68k 
series and the arcade game. 4 operators, with channel 8, it has 
been similar to OPN well.</td></tr>
<tr><th>OPN system</th>
<td>OPN (YM2203) /OPNA (YM2608/YMF288) /OPN2 
(YM2612/YM3438/YMF276) /OPNB (YM2610) there was (B) was used with 
PC-88, PC-98, FM-TOWNS and Mega drive. 4 operator channel 3 
(channel 6) + SSG channel 3 (OPN2 you release OPNA and OPN2) with, the
rhythm sound source and the ADPCM sound source are loaded in OPNA. 
The waveform is sign wave fixing. Being something which
speech synthesis mode and ADPCM percentage is loved from YM2608, it 
does YMF288 which is stacked in PC-9801-118. OPNB in the sound 
source of neo GeoCities, is FM 4 sound + SSG 3 sound + ADPCM7 sound.</td></tr>
<tr><th>OPP</th>
<td>Tip/chip name with YM2164, was loaded onto YAMAHA and 
the KORG make synthesizer. The superior interchangeability of 
OPM it seems, is, but as for the difference it is not well understood.</td></tr>
<tr><th>OPS</th>
<td>With LSI which in name machine DX7 and the like of the 
past years was stacked, they are 6 operator 32 algorithms.</td></tr>
<tr><th>OPZ</th>
<td>It was loaded onto the synthesizer of V50 and the like.
They are 4 operator 8 sounds, but this 2 being loaded by the 
actual synthesizer, they are 16 sound poly- phonic. The basic 
waveform can be selected from several types.</td></tr>
<tr><th>In addition</th>
<td>There is a synthesizer which is called to the strongest
last FM sound source, FS1R, they are as many as 8 operator 88 
algorithms. There is a software synthesizer which imitates DX7, 
FM7, but it seems that is 8 operator modes even in this. When it
comes to here, aiming, the unreasonable air does that it makes sound 
first.</td></tr>

<h2>FM sound source chip comparison</h2>

The recent portable telephone has MIDI sound 
source common efficiency.
It tried making the comparison table of the FM sound source of 
the personal computer then.
As expected because there is opening 15 years in release time, 
the portable telephone is high function.
Is, it is to do, setting precision of each parameter OPNA is on.
