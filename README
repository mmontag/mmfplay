MMFplay - A player for SMAF files

The player currently uses an YMF262 emulator as a proof of concept. The
idea is to write a 2/4OP FM tone generator with 32/16 channels similar
to the YMU262. Meanwhile, features can be implemented and tested with
the YMF262.


Current status:

- tested in Linux
- compiles on Linux, Solaris and BSD
- plays MA-3 SMAF files using GM instruments in YMF262 (4OP and 2OP modes)
- doesn't understand SMAF files converted from SMF
- with OPL2 output it sounds bad
- with OPL3 output it sounds really bad
- testing with BlueGrass.mmf, Carousel.mmf and MachineWoman.mmf


TODO:

- rework the ymf262 emulator to something closer to the ymu262
- support smaf files converted from smf
- support multi-track midi
- implement midi controllers
